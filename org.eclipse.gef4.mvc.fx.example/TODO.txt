- Convert example geometries to be origin-based, position them via affine transform
- Implement HandlePolicy -> use to create selection/focus/hover handles for individual content parts, let HandleTool create  
  selection box handles, maybe also via handle policy of root part
- Add outline handles also for non-rectangle shapes; restrict resizing options for rectangle-based shapes via constraints on handles
- Implement outline segment midpoint handles (like bendpoints) to allow "morphing" of shapes
- Add support for removing bendpoints and outline segment midpoint handles

- Ensure factories and policies can be obtained on a default/type/instance based binding registry
- Ensure default model implementations can be binded (using DI or custom binding mechanism) per viewer (no type/instance binding)

- Ensure visual part and content part registries are based on scopes (hierarchy)
- Add support for cursor changes to tools/handles

- Marquee Selection

- Show how shapes can be attached to each other via anchors (G shape of logo)
- PropertySheet integration to change visual properties of FXGeometricVisuals (incl. UNDO)
- Implement resize for arbitrary geometric shapes (by using scaling)
- Implement undo/redo for resize and move
- Implement zooming based on gesture

- Add viewport (scrolling) model and tools for scrolling and related birdeye view to UI feature)
- Add focus model (keyboard focus)
